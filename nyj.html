    <h1>BORN A CRIME</h1>
    <h2>By: Trevoh Noah</h2>
    <h3>Chapter 1 </h3>
    <br>
    <p>Chapter 1 provides an overview of the historical context in South Africa before and during apartheid,<br> focusing
        on the rivalry between the Zulu and Xhosa tribes. It highlights the impact of apartheid on the country's people,<br>
        with particular emphasis on the experiences of Nelson Mandela, who was Xhosa like Trevor Noah's mother. <br>
        Trevor Noah, the author, introduces himself as a product of apartheid, born in 1984, and presents anecdotes from <br>
        his childhood that illustrate the complexities of living in a racially segregated society. <br>
        The chapter delves into Trevor's upbringing within a devout Christian family, where attending church was a <br>
        significant part of their weekly routine. Despite the logistical challenges of getting to various churches,<br> Trevor's
        mother's unwavering faith in God is highlighted, along with an incident <br> where she bravely confronts a menacing
        bus driver, ultimately saving Trevor's life.
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chapter 2 </h3>
        Chapter 2 delves deeper into the apartheid regime, tracing its origins back to Dutch colonizers in the 17th
        century, <br>its formalization by the Afrikaners after British rule ended. <br> Trevor shares the story of his birth,
        being born to a Black mother and a white Swiss father, which was illegal under apartheid laws. <br> His mother's
        courage in navigating the complexities of interracial relationships, <br> including seeking sanctuary with a Swiss
        friend in Johannesburg to give birth, is portrayed. <br>Trevor's existence was against the law, leading to secrecy and
        fear for his family's safety, with his mother having to evade questions about his light skin. <br>
        The chapter also highlights the harsh realities faced by mixed-race individuals under apartheid, including the
        constant threat of being taken by the police, <br> as well as the difficult choices faced by Trevor's mother, who chose
        to stay in South Africa despite the risks. <br>Through these anecdotes, Trevor Noah provides a personal and
        poignant insight into the intricacies of life in apartheid-era South Africa, <br>setting the stage for further exploration
        of his childhood experiences in subsequent chapters.</p>
